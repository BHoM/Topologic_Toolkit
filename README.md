## Welcome to Topologic_Toolkit
[Topologic](https://topologic.app) is a software modelling library enabling hierarchical and topological representations of architectural spaces, buildings and artefacts through non-manifold topology (NMT). Topologic is designed as a core library and additional plugins to visual data flow programming (VDFP) applications and parametric modelling platforms commonly used in architectural design practice. These applications provide workspaces with visual programming nodes and connections for architects to interact with Topologic and perform architectural design and analysis tasks.

# BHoM

A great place to start with BHoM is reading our Wiki [here](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki) including pages like the [Structure of the BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Structure-of-the-BHoM) and [Using the BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Using-the-BHoM).

## Quick start ##

Try the [installer](https://bhom.xyz/) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).



## Building the BHoM and the Toolkits from Source ##
You will need the following to build BHoM:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and above (included with Visual Studio 2013)
- Note that there are no software - specific dependencies (only operating system relevant), this is specific: BHoM is a software agnostic object model.


### Clone and build the Core BHoM Repos

In the following build order:
- [BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM)
- [BHoM_Engine](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Engine)
- [BHoM_Adapter](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_Adapter)
- [BHoM_UI](https://github.com/BHoM/BHoM_UI)

- [Socket_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Socket_Toolkit)
- [Mongo_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Mongo_Toolkit)


Build as many as you like of your chosen Interop Toolkits:
- [Revit_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Revit_Toolkit)
- [Robot_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Robot_Toolkit)
- [ETABS_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/ETABS_Toolkit)
- [Lusas_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Lusas_Toolkit)
- [GSA_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/GSA_Toolkit)
- [TAS_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/TAS_Toolkit)
- [XML_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/XML_Toolkit)

Then build as many User Interface Repositories as you like:
- [Rhinoceros_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Rhinoceros_Toolkit) & [Grasshopper_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Grasshopper_Toolkit) (you need both)
- [Dynamo_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Dynamo_Toolkit)
- [Excel_Toolkit](https://github.com/BHoM/Excel_Toolkit)


You are good to go! 

## Topologic_Toolkit :sparkling_heart:

[Topologic_Toolkit](https://topologic.app/software/) is all about generating waterthight spaces. The most versatile :sparkles: method of controlling model qulaity!

To find out more about Topologic_Toolkit and get started, **see guidance on the [Topologic_Toolkit Wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/Topologic_Toolkit/wiki) page.**   
...regardless if you are MEP engineer, Energy modeler, Building Physicist,  Grasshopper, DynamoBIM or Excel user.
